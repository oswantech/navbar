    Best: Lots of hackathons, side projects, robotics competitions and student club activities - the applicant didn't even have C# listed on their resume, but it shows they can *<b>*learn things outside of their comfort zone*</b>* and *<b>*take initiative in their work*</b>*.
    
    Worst: Just a big list of languages and frameworks that the applicant has self-appraised themselves as being "highly proficient" in. <b>Show me the project/job where you used those skills so I can gauge how relevant the experience is.</b>
